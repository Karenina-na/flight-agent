# SkyPilot

SkyPilot is a small generic LangChain/LangGraph agent demo. It uses an
OpenAI-compatible local chat model, a runtime context object, LangGraph memory,
skill middleware, and a registry-based tool loading system.

## Project Layout

- `main.py` - local Web UI demo entrypoint.
- `src/agent.py` - builds the LangChain agent.
- `src/chat/` - shared browser session, agent runner, and JSON trace helpers.
- `src/config/` - loads YAML configuration.
- `src/runtime.py` - defines runtime context passed into tools.
- `src/memory/` - builds LangGraph checkpointers, stores, and memory middleware.
- `src/observability/` - configures structured logging and agent lifecycle events.
- `src/skills/` - loads filesystem-backed skills and exposes skill middleware.
- `src/summarization/` - builds conversation summarization middleware.
- `src/prompt/` - builds system prompts from independent layers.
- `src/tools/` - registry-based tool package.
- `src/web_ui/` - stdlib browser UI and local JSON API.

## Tool Registration

Business code should import tools only through:

```python
from src.tools import get_tools
```

To add a new tool:

1. Create a new module under `src/tools/`, for example `src/tools/example.py`.
2. Define a LangChain tool with `@tool`.
3. Register it with `register_tool(my_tool)`.

The package auto-discovers local tool modules when `get_tools()` is called, so
`src/agent.py` does not need to change when tools are added or removed.

## Prompt Layers

System prompts are composed from independent modules in `src/prompt/`:

- `base.py` - `CORE_PROMPT` and `DOMAIN_PROMPT`.
- `capabilities.py` - tool, skill, and MCP prompt layer rendering.
- `build.py` - final `build_system_prompt()` composition.
- `__init__.py` - stable public prompt imports.

`src/agent.py` builds the prompt with the same tool list passed into the agent:

```python
tools = get_tools()
system_prompt = build_system_prompt(tools=tools)
```

This keeps concrete tool names out of the base prompt layers while still giving
the model an up-to-date view of the tools available at runtime.

## Local Setup

This project expects Python 3.12.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Configuration

Configuration is YAML-only. Start from the committed example file:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

`config.yaml` is ignored by Git so local model endpoints and API keys do not get
committed. The loader reads `config.example.yaml` as default values, then overlays
`config.yaml` when it exists. This lets new config fields get safe defaults while
keeping local overrides private.

The default example points to a local OpenAI-compatible model endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1
```

### Memory

Conversation memory is configured through the `memory` section:

```yaml
memory:
  checkpointer:
    type: "in_memory"
  store:
    enabled: true
    type: "in_memory"
```

The checkpointer stores same-thread graph state, including message history.
The store is LangGraph's long-term memory surface for cross-thread or
user-scoped data. The in-memory implementations are appropriate for local demos
and tests.

`src/memory/` also provides middleware-private demo memory tools:

- `remember_user_fact` - writes a stable user fact to the configured store.
- `recall_user_facts` - reads remembered facts for the runtime user.

These tools are attached through memory middleware and are not registered in the
global business tool registry.

### Observability

Structured logging is configured through the `observability` section:

```yaml
observability:
  logging:
    enabled: true
    level: "INFO"
    format: "text"
    redact: true
```

The first version uses Python's standard `logging` module. It records agent
lifecycle events such as model and tool call start, end, and error with runtime
context ids like `user_id`, `thread_id`, `request_id`, and `run_id`. Logs do not
include full prompts, full model responses, full tool arguments, memory values,
or skill file contents by default.

Runtime id semantics:

- `request_id` - one external request or Web UI chat operation.
- `run_id` - one agent execution inside that request.
- `thread_id` - LangGraph conversation thread used by the checkpointer.

Core events:

| Event | Trigger | Default fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_run_start` | Agent stream/run begins | `entrypoint`, `stream_mode`, runtime ids |
| `agent_run_end` | Agent stream/run completes | `duration_ms`, `entrypoint`, `stream_mode`, runtime ids |
| `agent_run_error` | Agent stream/run raises | `duration_ms`, `error_type`, runtime ids |
| `model_call_start` | Model call begins | `message_count`, `tool_count`, runtime ids |
| `model_call_end` | Model call completes | `duration_ms`, `message_count`, runtime ids |
| `model_call_error` | Model call raises | `duration_ms`, `error_type`, runtime ids |
| `tool_call_start` | Tool call begins | `tool_name`, `argument_keys`, runtime ids |
| `tool_call_end` | Tool call completes | `duration_ms`, `status`, `tool_name`, runtime ids |
| `tool_call_error` | Tool call raises | `duration_ms`, `error_type`, `tool_name`, runtime ids |
| `memory_write` | Memory value is saved | `memory_key`, runtime ids |
| `memory_read` | Memory values are recalled | `memory_count`, runtime ids |
| `memory_disabled` | Memory tool runs without a store | `operation`, runtime ids |
| `skill_loaded` | Skill instructions are loaded | `skill_name`, runtime ids |
| `skill_file_listed` | Skill support files are listed | `skill_name`, `file_count`, runtime ids |
| `skill_file_read` | Skill support file is read | `skill_name`, `relative_path`, runtime ids |
| `skill_file_rejected` | Skill support file read is rejected | `skill_name`, `relative_path`, `reason`, runtime ids |
| `skill_lookup_failed` | Requested skill is not registered | `skill_name`, runtime ids |

The logging layer remains intentionally lightweight in v1: it uses stdlib
logging only and does not require LangSmith, OpenTelemetry, or a remote
collector.

### Summarization

Conversation summarization is configured in YAML:

```yaml
summarization:
  enabled: true
  model: "main"
  timeout_seconds: 45
  max_retries: 0
  reasoning_enabled: false
  trigger:
    type: "fraction"
    value: 0.55
  keep:
    type: "fraction"
    value: 0.35
  trim_tokens_to_summarize: 3000
```

The default `trigger.fraction: 0.55` starts summarization before the visible
message history plus the fixed system prompt/tool schemas can overflow smaller
local model contexts. The default `keep.fraction: 0.35` preserves the most recent
portion by token budget rather than by message count, which is important when
tool results are large. Because fractional limits need a known context window,
set `llm.context_window_tokens` for the selected model.

L3-L5 semantic compression requires the configured summary model to return a
visible structured result. Some local reasoning models may spend most of their
generation on internal reasoning and fail to return complete JSON. When this is
detected, the process marks semantic summarization unavailable and immediately
uses the deterministic compression result for later requests instead of
repeating the slow failing call. Configure `summarization.model` with a
dedicated non-reasoning model when the main model has this behavior. Restarting
the process resets the capability check.

## Run

Start the local browser demo:

```bash
.venv/bin/python main.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

The Web UI keeps one in-memory browser session at a time. It supports:

- Natural-language air ticket questions through `/api/chat`.
- Starting a fresh conversation through `/api/new`.
- Inspecting registered tools through `/api/tools`.
- Running a built-in air-ticket quote demo through `/api/demo`.
- Writing full multi-turn JSON traces under `logs/traces/`.

## Verify

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/python -c "from src.tools import get_tools; print([t.name for t in get_tools()])"
.venv/bin/python -c "from src.agent import agent; print(type(agent).__name__)"
```
